In batch mode we re-compute the diffusion distance for each point.
In incremental we call incremental diffusion maps procedure for every 10 points we still do not recompute but keep on approximating on previously obtained values.

Timing summary:
Total elapsed time for batch update 31.929482 seconds.
Total elapsed time for incremental update is 6.966448 seconds.
Initial size 1600
Number of iterations 40
